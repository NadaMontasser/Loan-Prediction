# Loan-Prediction
A project that employs machine learning to determine whether a person is more likely to receive the loan that he or she is offered. We trained our model on a variety of datasets depicting various types of people with varying status and proclivity to repay the loan, and our model recognised the pattern of the data, which we used to build a simple webapp with flask to demonstrate the process.
